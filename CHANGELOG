# CHANGELOG

## [2.0.0] - 2020-04-15

### Added
- A default timeout handler.
- The postTimeout configuration, meaning a callback to be executed after the default timout handler.
- The bypassCache parameter to the constructor.
- Object's properties list at the beginning of the class.
- The @version tag in code documentation
- This CHANGELOG.

### Changed
- There must be a function named 'JHRWHandler' to handle JHRW. The changing in name (previously 'defaultHandler') was done to prevent naming conflicts.
- The example handler (see above) now resides on the testing script, as it should.
- Timeouts are now explicitly handled by JHRW and therefore can't be configured anymore. See postTimeout above.
- The request is now created by the init method.
- The example tester is now more sophisticated, allowing for better testing.
- availableHandlers is now a static property.
- The project is now licensed under MIT (no big deal, I'm just standardizing my projects under the same license).
- Overall revamped documentation (README.md).
- JHRW now has a 'base' parameter and a 'urlPath' parameter, instead of the unified - and wrong - 'destination' parameter.
- All "timed" configurations (e.g.: ''timeout') are now handled in seconds.

### Fixed
- JHRW now correctly detects and retries timed out requests.
- The configure method documentation now states that it's parameter should be an Object (not JSON, since JSON doesn\'t allow functions).
